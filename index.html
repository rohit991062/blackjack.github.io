                <h2>Blackjack Rules</h2>
                <p>1. The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
                <p>2. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</p>
                <p>3. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</p>
                <p>4. To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</p>
                <p>5. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</p>
                <p>6. If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.</p>
                <p>7. Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</p>
                <p>8. Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled, and you only get one more card.</p>
                <p>9. Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.</p>
